* Goals
** Manage =orders=
*** =Manager= can create =orders= based on a discord role
*** =Subbot= can split orders into different =jobs= 
*** =Worker= can subscribe to an =order= by choosing =job types=
*** =Manager= can follow the completion of orders
*** =Subbot= can ping the =delivery= role when an =order= is complete

** Give people work based on =job types=
*** =Subbot= keeps track on the different =jobs=
*** =Subbot= offers available jobs to =workers=

** Manage a database of =parts= and =mats= needed
*** =Subbot= helps deciding if =Worker= has to craft or buy =mats=
*** =Subbot= keeps a stock

** Manage payments

* References
* Ideas
- Not discord roles, but the bot could handle a job queue system and people could be able to register on some job types
Like you type /gimmework
The bot replies with a prompt of the jobs available. You choose some on them. 
THen the bot replies with your next job.
